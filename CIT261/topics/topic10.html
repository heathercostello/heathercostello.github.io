        <h2>HTML5 tags: Video, Audio, Canvas</h2>

        <!-- VIDEO TAG -->
        <hr>
        <h2>Video Tag</h2>



        <p>The video tag specifies video, such as a movie clip or other video streams. It is a new tag for HTML5.</p>

        <p>Currently, there are 3 supported video formats for the video element: MP4, WebM, and Ogg</p>

        <p>The code always has to open up with an opening and a closing 'video' tag.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>One can use 'attributes' to specify the peramaters of the video.</p>

        <p>Below is an example of a video with the attributes of 'height', 'width', 'autoplay', 'loop', and 'src'</p>

        <p>'src' is ALWAYS needed since that is where we get the video file.</p>

        <P>'autoplay' makes it so the user cannot click play, pause or use the volume</p>

        <p>'loop' will play the video over and over</p>

        <p>'width' and 'height' describe how large the video will be shown on a browser in pixels</p>

        <h3>Basic Example of a video tag</h3>

        <p>This example below shows the 'loop' and 'autoplay' attributes.</p>

        <img class="code" src="../images/code1.png" alt="code1"><br>

        <video width="320" height="240" autoplay loop>
            <source src="../video/ocean.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <p>This example shows the attribute 'controls'<br> 'controls' is what adds on the play, pause, and sound buttons
        </p>

        <img class="code" src="../images/code2.png" alt="code2"><br>

        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="../video/ocean.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="../video/ocean.oog" type="video/oog">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

        <p>*One can put more sources as shown in the example above.<br> If the computer does not recognize any of the sources,
            <br> it will write out what is between the video tags.<br> In this case, it would write out "Your browser does not support the video tag.*
        </p>

        <!-- AUDIO TAG -->
        <hr>
        <h2>Audio Tag</h2>


        <p>The audio tag defines sound, such as music or other audio streams.<br> It is very similar to the video tag.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, there are 3 supported video formats for the audio element: MP3, OGG, and WAV</p>

        <p>The code always has to open up with an opening and a closing 'audio' tag.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>One can use 'attributes' to specify the peramaters of the audio.</p>

        <p>'src' is ALWAYS needed since that is where we get the video file.</p>

        <P>'autoplay' makes it so the user cannot click play, pause or use the volume</p>

        <p>'controls' specifies that audio controls should be displayed</p>

        <p>'loop' will play the video over and over</p>

        <p>'muted' specifies that the audio output should be muted</p>

        <p>'preload' specifies if and how the author thinks the audio should be loaded when the page laods</p>

        <h3>Basic Example of an audio tag</h3>

        <p>This example below shows the controls attribute.</p>

        <img class="code" src="../images/audiocode.png" alt="audiocode"><br>

        <audio controls>
            <source src="../audio/example.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            <source src="../audio/example.mp3" type="audio/oog">
            Your browser does not support the audio tag.
        </audio>


        <p>*One can put more sources as shown in the example above.<br> If the computer does not recognize any of the sources,
            <br> it will write out what is between the video tags.<br> In this case, it would write out "Your browser does not support the video tag.*
        </p>

        <!-- CANVAS TAG -->
        <hr>
        <h2>Canvas Tag</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Usage</h3>
        <p>The 'canvas' tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).</p>
        <p>The 'canvas' tag is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.</p>
        <p>Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.</p>
        <p>Canvas can:
            <ul>
                <li>draw text</li>
                <li>draw graphics</li>
                <li>be animated</li>
                <li>be interactive</li>
                <li>be used in games</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What does canvas look like in HTML5?</h3>

        <img class="code" src="../images/canvascode1.png" alt="canvas code">

        <p>The 'canvas 'element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript.<br> The width and height attribute is necessary to define the size of the canvas.<br> You can have multiple 'canvas' elements on one HTML page.</p>

        <h3>Canvas Drawing Example</h3>

        <p>*All drawing on the HTML canvas must be done with JavaScript*</p>

        <img class="code" src="../images/canvascode2.png" alt="canvascode 2"><br>

        <canvas id="my_canvas" width="300" height="300" style="border:2px dotted #a4b8a4;">
                Your browser does not support the canvas element.
        </canvas>

        <script>
            var canvas = document.getElementById("my_canvas");
            var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
            ctx.fillStyle = "#CCE2D1";
            ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 150, 75);
        </script>

        <h3>Draw a Line with Canvas</h3>

        <p>"Define a starting point in position (0,0), and an ending point in position (200,100).<br> Then use the stroke() method to actually draw the line:"</p>

        <p>To draw a straight line on a canvas, use the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li>moveTo(x,y) - defines the starting point of the line</li>
                <li>lineTo(x,y) - defines the ending point of the line</li>
            </ul>
            To actually draw the line, you must use one of the "ink" methods, like stroke().</p>

        <img class="code" src="../images/canvascode3.png"><br>

        <canvas id="myCanvas2" width="300" height="300" style="border:2px dotted #471717;">
                Your browser does not support the canvas element.
        </canvas>

        <script>
            var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas2");
            var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
            ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
            ctx.lineTo(300, 300);
            ctx.stroke();
        </script>
