    <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
    <h2>Object Creation Functions, Inheritance, Properties, Methods, Instantiation</h2>
    <p>Objects are everything in JavaScript. If you can understand objects then you will be able to understand JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In JavaScript, almost everything is an object. All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        </li>
        <li>Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        </li>
        <li>Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
        </li>
        <li>Dates are always objects
        </li>
        <li>Maths are always objects
        </li>
        <li>Regular expressions are always objects
        </li>
        <li>Arrays are always objects
        </li>
        <li>Functions are always objects
        </li>
        <li>Objects are always objects
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Creation</h3>
    <h4>Object Initializers -used to create objects. There are three different ways. Spaces do not matter.</h4>
    <p>var car = {<br> carMake: "Ford",<br> carModel: "F150",<br> carYear: "2013"<br> };
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>var car = { carMake: "Ford", carModel: "F150", carYear: "2013"};
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>var car = new Object();<br> car.carMake = "Ford";<br> car.carModel = "F150";<br> car.carYear = "2013";<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Properites</h3>
    <p>A collection of properties are basically whatmakes up an object. A property is made up of a key (name) and a value. A dictionary is a great example of this. The dictionary represents an object, the term represents the key, and the definition represents
        the value. Properties are used to define the characteristic of the object.
    </p>
    <p>To access the property, we use this syntax<br> objectName.propertyName
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>It is easy to add and delete properties.</p>
    <p>Example of creating an object, adding properties, and then deleting a property.</p>
    <p>*creating a new object</p>
    <p>var arizonaStaples = new Object ();<br> *adding three new properties<br> arizonaStaples.food = "Bean Burritos";<br> arizonaStaples.weather = "Sunny";<br> arizonaStaples.landscape = "Cactus";<br> *deleting one property<br> delete arizonaStaples.weather;</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>Methods are stored in an object the same way that a property is. Instead of just storing a value though, they store a function.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>var car = { carMake: "Ford", carModel: "F150", carYear: "2013", carMM: "function"(){return this.carMake + this.carModel}};
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. The Object.prototype is on top of the prototype inheritance chain. Once the prototype has been created, newinstances of the object can be made. The object can then be changed
        by adding new properties or methods and then ahve new objects created from it. It is cool because it allows code to be reused without it having to be written again.
