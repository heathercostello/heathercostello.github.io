        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>Dom, JSON, and AJAX were the three topics that I studied this week. JSON made WAY more sense to me than it ever has this week so that is awesome. I love using w3schools as a resource because I like the way that things break down. We met as a team,
            just Merrit and I and went over our topics that we were to present this week.
