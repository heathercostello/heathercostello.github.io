        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>This week was a little rough. It was SO hard for me to get AJAX to work. I feel like I was able to understand the concept pretty quick but could not get it to work for the life of me. I tried so many different JSON files and web services. I finally
            got one to work. I kept running into the error of my computer not letting me grab the data, I cannot remember the name of the error. I asked the tutor about the error and he said he did not even know how to fix it. I learned though that AJAX
            helps you in many ways. It updates without you having to update and constantly refresh the data. It is an awesome concept. Jesse presented on Local Storage. I thought this was a cool concept. It was a little familiar to me. I will probably
            need to study it a littl more though.
