        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>During Week 3, I learned about the basics of JavaScript. It was a really good refresher on functions, variables, arrays, etc. I also was refreshed on the idea of JavaScript Objects and how to create them. I feel like it helped me to learn the
            idea of JavaScript even further. I taught HTML5 Tags (Video, Audio, and Canvas) which is an easy concept to grasp. I have used the HTML5 tags before.
