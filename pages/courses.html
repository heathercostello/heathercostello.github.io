        <p>CIT 336 <strong>Web Backend Development</strong><br>This course prepares students to plan, develop, and construct dynamic web sites using HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL, and MySQL databases. This is a programming course; previous programming experience
            will be helpful.</p>

        <p>COMM 310 <strong>Creating Online Media</strong><br>Students in the Creating Online Media course explore the creation and design of web pages, while learning to apply the design principles learned in Comm 130 Visual Media in an online/digital medium.
            Students will study HTML and CSS with an emphasis on how visual communication can entice, engage, and authenticate the information that is being delivered online. At the end of the course the students will deliver a website, on a topic of
            their choosing, that demonstrates both principles of design and validating HTML/CSS.</p>

        <p>CS 371 <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong><br>CS 371, Human Computer Interaction, will focus on the methods in which we can communicate often complex technical concepts to people in an intuitive and non-intimidating manner, while being
            able to interpret input from people from a human-centric perspective.</p>

        <p>WDD 100 <strong>Intro to Web Design/Development</strong><br>This class serves as an introduction to web design and development. The course is designed to introduce students to basics of web technology, web design and development principles. The
            course uses hands-on activities with students actually participating in simple web design projects and programming.</p>

        <p>CIT 261 <strong>Mobile Application Development</strong><br>This course prepares professionals. The instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. Having a mentored learning experience is very important to your career. Since exploring technologies
            to solve previously unsolved problems is what you will eventually do. In this course you explore technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, to find, evaluate, and resolve problems. You will also create a single page mobile web application.
            You work in team but are responsible for your own learning. You provide evidence of your technology fluency. Additional professionalism evidence is also required.</p>

        <p>CIT 262 <strong>System Analysis and Design</strong><br>This course teaches the concepts of systems analysis and design for those desiring to work in the field of information technology. Initially, an overview of an information system and the software
            development life cycle (SDLC) processes are covered.</p>

        <p>CIT 270 <strong>Systems Security I</strong><br>The purpose of the course is to provide the student with an overview of the field of Information Security and Assurance. Students will be exposed to the spectrum of Security activities, methods, methodologies,
            and procedures. This course offers a comprehensive guide for anyone wishing to take the CompTIA Security+ SY0-301 Certification Exam. It provides an introduction to the fundamentals of network security, including compliance and operational
            security; threats and vulnerabilities; application, data, and host security; access control and identity management; and cryptography. The course covers new topics in network security as well, including psychological approaches to social engineering
            attacks, web application attacks, penetration testing, data loss prevention, cloud computing security, and application programming development security.</p>

        <p>CIT 365 <strong>.NET Software Development</strong><br>This course leverages a student's background and experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and fundamental, object-oriented programming with the Visual Studio IDE running the .NET framework using
            the C# programming language. During the course, students will build upon a C# foundation using the .NET framework to design and develop scalable, standards-based websites, applications, and services using contemporary methodologies and established
            design patterns. Teamwork and programming deliverables will be required.</p>

        <p>CS 308 <strong>Technical Communication</strong><br>This course is designed to help you hone your communication skills so you will be prepared to enter the technical workforce when you complete your degree.</p>

        <p>CS 313 <strong>Web Engineering II</strong><br>This course builds upon Web Engineering I allowing students to create more advanced web applications and services. The emphasis of this course will be on server-side technologies and n-tier applications
            using relational database technology. Different server-side technologies will be used for creating dynamic n-tier web applications. Client side technologies will be enhanced and combined with server-side technologies to create rich; web applications.</p>
