        <p>This website was created for a web front-end class at BYUI (CIT 230). I was to use a variety of web technologies including HTML5, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. Outside templates were not allowed, nor were pages built from site builder software. It
            contains 14 content pages and implements design principles. I also learned how to consume API's on this project and used a variety to display the current weather of a city, closure dates, and schedules.

        <p>This page is a site that I made for a Mobile Application Development Class at BYUI (CIT 261) to show/update the skils that I have mastered. I explored technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, to find, evaluate, and resolve problems. I
            recieved an A+ which represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. The course
            syllabus also states that recieving an A+ demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students.

        <p>In a Web Backend Development course, I learned how to construct dynamic web sites using PHP with databases and design patterns. We also learned to create custom Model View Controllers from scratch.
